## About

Rock Mine Project is a data analysis / machine learning notebook exploring the task of classifying or analyzing “rock” versus “mine” signals/data, using sonar (or similar) data. The project appears to make use of a CSV file (`sonar.csv`) containing feature measurements, and a Jupyter notebook (`RockMineProject.ipynb`) to explore, preprocess, model, and evaluate.

Goals of the project include:

* Data exploration and visualization of sonar signals
* Preprocessing features
* Training machine learning model(s) for classification (rock vs mine)
* Evaluating model performance

## Project Structure

Here is the layout of the repository:

```
Rock-Mine-Project/
├── RockMineProject.ipynb     # Jupyter notebook with code, experiments, visualizations
├── sonar.csv                  # Dataset: feature data for rock vs mine classification
├── README.md                  # This file
└── .gitignore (if present)     # Files/folders to ignore in version control
```

---

## Dependencies

The project uses Python (in a Jupyter notebook). Some of the typical libraries/tools required include:

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
* `pandas`
* `numpy`
* `scikit-learn`
* `matplotlib` / `seaborn`
* Any others used in the notebook (e.g. for model saving, metrics etc.)

You may install dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

Or using a virtual environment.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wazmiali/Rock-Mine-Project.git
   cd Rock-Mine-Project
   ```

2. **Ensure you have the dataset**
   The `sonar.csv` file should be in the project root. If it is missing, retrieve or download it.

3. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # on Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate      # on Windows
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If there's no `requirements.txt`, install manually as in [Dependencies](#dependencies).

5. **Open the notebook**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook RockMineProject.ipynb
   ```

   Or launch via Jupyter Lab.

---

## Usage

Inside the notebook, the typical workflow is:

1. Read dataset (`sonar.csv`)
2. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Preprocess data (scaling, encoding, train/test split etc.)
4. Train classifier(s) (ex: logistic regression, decision tree, SVM etc.)
5. Evaluate using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix
6. Possibly tune parameters, cross-validation

You can adapt or extend the notebook by trying different models, feature engineering, or hyperparameter tuning.

---

## Data

* **sonar.csv**: This file contains the dataset used for the project.
* Typical format: multiple numeric features from sonar signal data, plus a target/class label (rock vs mine).
* Data sources/credits: *\[if known, cite where the data came from]*

---

## Results

Include here a summary of findings (you can write this in the README once you run the notebook). Example:

* Model performance (accuracy, etc.)
* Key insights from the data (which features are most important)
* Observations from EDA
